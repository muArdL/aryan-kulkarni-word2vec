The paper "Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space" or "Word2Vec" by Tomas Mikolov claims that the CBOW and Skip-Gram models learn 
meaningful word representations faster and more efficiently than traditional neural language models. 
They work better because their simpler architectures reduce computational complexity, allowing training on much larger text corpora while still capturing 
semantic and syntactic relationships between words. 
To test the paper's claim, the core Skip-Gram architecture must be implemented. The model takes a center word as input and learns to predict 
surrounding context words within a fixed window. Training is performed using Negative Sampling, where the model increases similarity between the center word
and true context words while decreasing similarity with randomly sampled negative words. The implementation requires building a vocabulary, 
generating Skip-Gram training pairs, learning word embeddings through gradient descent, and evaluating the resulting embeddings using similarity and analogy tasks.
